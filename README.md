## React Popper - Typescript

React wrapper around [PopperJS](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/)
Fork of [React-Popper](https://github.com/souporserious/react-popper) and now has the following additional functionality
 - More type-safe than before
 - Allows you to use whatever version of popper.js you want to use
 - Written in typescript so your *.d.ts will be correct
 - Able to install directly from github (though not suggested)
 - Developing is easier
 - Test coverage coming soon!
